A very simple program intended to keep WSL alive when executed via a scheduled task, service, or manual execution.  The executable first creates a lock file in /tmp to ensure the program is only executed once.  It then sleeps infinitely.  If another instance is started, it will fail to get a lock on the lock file and exit.  This allows the program to be executed multiple times without worrying about ending up with many instances running.
